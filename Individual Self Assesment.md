## Self Assesment

My Self Assesment is going to be a little different from the rest, because due to personal circunstances I had to the project all by myself. I fullfiled all the roles with the exception of the circle, since that is the part that I strugle the must, and I did not figure out the way to use schema in my project, however I set up the repository and I cleaned the database using pandas and I also picked the machine learning model with a little help from the Internet. Sadly, for me I could not receive feedback on my project since I had to finish it after the course was finish, and oh boy, would I love to have the help specially with the data integration part.

The grestest personal challenge for me was time, because I came to the corse with no much knowledges of the topics, so I have to go back and forth between the modules and the challenges to remind myself of things we have covered in the past. The way I overcame this obstacle is to see the project through no mater what, even if it's not as polished as I would like it to be. I think working as a team would be greatly benefitial, alas, I could not do it.

I am very happy that I took my time, and I went through the modules so I can get a better understanding of the topics, specially machine learning. It was my first time using it, and the project force me to do a lot of reading to understand it and implemented it in a way that helped my project, and I am also happy very pleased wit my cleaning data process. 

One thing that have frustrated me through the entire project and course is whhen your code does not seem to work and in the end is a little mistake that is caiusing, so I learned more detail oriented in the way we write code.


## Team Assesment

As I stated before there was no team, so no communication protocols, my advise for the future would be to chose the data you want to analize early because you might have to change midtrhough the way you look at it.

## Summmary of the Project

I wanted to do something related to sports, and I hear in every talk sport show radio how analytics are a big part of sport now, but I never though about analytics when I was watching soccer, but the truth is that we do see statistics in every game: Time of possesion, shots, goals, etc. So why can't we apply those statistics and try to do a sstudy about the player. I chose to focus on strikers because sincerely, it's easier to measure them. If you are a good striker, you score goals. 

At first I try to use the model machines used on the challenges, but They did not give me the results I wanted, so I founf a code onthe Internet that I use to find the best machine learning model, and after that I just needed to apply the same principles using that model.

The result of my analisis is that you can indeed try to preoject how many goals a striker could socore base on their shot selection, and we could go deepeer and find out different aspects of their game. Now that I think about it, I am guessing that's how the FIFA EA sport game get the rating for the players.
